Files created for Pragmatic Programming '14-'15

The officer folder was meant to be accessible by only club officers who would be able to help in the planning and writing of events.  The member folder is what was meant to be accessible by anybody and was usually a copy of what is in the officer folder.  Since the folders are now both public on GitHub, the member folder may not be updated as of this repository's creation on 3/14/15.
