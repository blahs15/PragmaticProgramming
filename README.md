Files created for Pragmatic Programming '14-'15

The officer folder was meant to be accessible by only club officers who would be able to help in the planning and writing of events.  
The member folder is what was meant to be accessible by anybody and was usually a copy of what is in the officer folder.  
Since the folders are now both public on GitHub, the member folder may not be updated as of this repository's creation on 3/14/15.

## DarkMaze
Contains a maze generator in C++.  It was written for a competition held in February 2015.  The goal was to find the exit in as few steps as possible.  The contestants had to write their code in C++, calling the functions I provided: go~Direction~() and look~Direction~().  They would use only the information provided from these functions to decide their path.  

## Hangman
Simple hangman program that was potentially going to be used as a practice program to learn how to program.  It was determined to be too complicated for a very quick tutorial for brand new programmers. 

## Minesweeper
Contains a Minesweeper field generator in C++.  It was written for a competition held in January 2015.  The goal was to create the best solver using functions provided which emulated what can be done in a Minesweeper game with a UI.  

## Nonogram
Contains a Nonogram puzzle generator and solution checker.

## **gdbTutorial
Contains a tutorial for how to debug using GDB, a command line debugger.  The tutorial is inside the README.txt file.  C++ programs that are paired with the tutorial are provided.  Debugging is a very useful skill, and this is often considered one of the most useful things I did in Pragmatic Programming.
